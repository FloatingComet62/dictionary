The value assigned to a genus is wholly arbitrary\u2014that is, it is entirely a matter of opinion or current usage what characters shall be considered generic and thus constitute a genus; and genera are constantly modified and shifted by specialists, the tendency being mostly to restriction of genera, with the consequent multiplication of their number, and the coinage of new generic names. A genus has no natural, much less necessary, definition, its meaning being at best a matter of expert opinion; and the same is true of the species, family, order, class, etc. A genus of the animal kingdom in the time of Linn\u00e6us and other early naturalists was a group of species approximately equivalent to a modern family, sometimes even to an order. Probably upward of 100,000 generic names of as many supposed genera have been coined or used in zo\u00f6logy; those in current use at present are estimated at about 60,000, or an average of about (rather more than) one genus for every five species in the animal kingdom. In botany the genera are less restricted and average a much larger number of species, the 9,000 phanerogamic genera, for example, including 100,000 species. The tenable name of any genus is that which has priority of publication, if it has been properly published and characterized, and is not the same as the prior name of some other genus. The names of the genus and the species together form the scientific name of an animal or a plant. In writing the technical name of any animal or plant, the generic term always precedes the specific, and begins with a capital letter: as, Musca domestica , the house-fly, where Musca is the genus, and domestica differentiates the species. Genera are often subdivided into lesser groups called subgenera. (See subgenus .) A group of genera constitutes a family or subfamily. The name of a genus as such has properly no plural. If a genus name, as for example Ada , is pluralized, as Ad\u0153 , it means, not two or more genera named Ada , but either all the species of Ada , or some supergeneric group of which Ada is the type. The former usage is loose, or somewhat cant; the latter is frequent and regular in zo\u00f6logy. A genus name is always supposed to be Latin (though its derivation is in the great majority of cases from the Greek), and its plural, if used, is in Latin form; but when it is also Anglicized an English plural is used: as, the chinchillas , the animals of the genus Chinchilla."}, {"part_of_speech": "noun", "category": "", "explanation": "In old music , a formula or method of dividing the tetrachord.

The absorption of oxygen is necessary for the chemical changes which always accompany growth. The degree of warmth needed to excite to action the vital forces of the plant varies in different species, some seeds, as those of wheat, being capable of germinating upon melting ice, while others require a temperature of over 60\u00b0 F. During germination various chemical changes take place in the starch and other insoluble material stored up for the use of the embryo in the cotyledons or in the albumen of the seed, rendering them soluble and fit for assimilation, which changes are usually accompanied by an increase of temperature, as is seen in the process of malting. As an immediate result of the growing process thus excited and carried on in the seed, a root is produced which strikes downward, fixing itself in the soil and beginning to absorb thence nourishment for the new plant.

A specter is an alarming or horrifying preternatural personal appearance, having less individuality, perhaps, than a ghost or shade , but more than an apparition necessarily has.

Gladness is less often used of a weak feeling than glad ; it generally stands for a feeling that is strong but tranquil, and showing itself chiefly iu the face. Hence it is often used poetically of certain aspects of nature. Joy is more vivid and demonstrative. This distinction between gladness and joy is abundantly illustrated in the Bible. Pleasure is the most general of these words, representing all degrees of feeling, and vicious or harmful indulgence as well as harmless enjoyment. In its primary sense it indicates a feeling less distinctively cheerful than gladness and less profound or demonstrative than joy , but with much of glow. Delight is a high degree of pleasure ; formerly the word was much used for low pleasure (see quotation from Milton under delight ), but it has been redeemed so that it is now rarely used for anything but an ecstatic pleasure or joy. Triumph is often used for joy over success, especially joy in victory. All these words may express malign feelings, as joy in the adversities of a rival, except gladness , which generally expresses a pure and worthy feeling.
