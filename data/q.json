Quality is that which makes or helps to make a person or thing such as he or it is. It is not universal, and in one popular sense it implies an excellence or a defect. In popular speech a quality is intellectual or moral; in metaphysics it may be also physical. A property is that which is viewed as peculiarly one's own, a peculiar quality. An attribute is a high and lofty character: the attributes of Cod are natural, as omniscience, omnipotence, etc., and moral, as holiness, justice, mercy, etc. \u201c Accident is an abbreviated expression for accidental or contingent quality.\u201d ( Sir W. Hamilton , Metaph., vi.) Characteristic is not a term of logic or philosophy; it stands for a personal, peculiar, or distinguishing quality: as, yellow in skin, horn, milk, etc., is a characteristic of Guernsey cattle. Characteristics may be mental, moral, or physical. Character is the most general of these words; a character is anything which is true of a subject. In another sense character (as a collective term) is the sum of the characteristics of a person or thing, especially the moral characteristics. The word always views them as making a unit or whole, and has lower and higher uses. The other words are somewhat technical. Affection is used in various senses. Predicate and mark are very general words in logic. Difference is a character distinguishing one class of objects from others. Diathesis , the corresponding Greek form, is applied in medicine to peculiarities of constitution.

A quarrel is a matter of ill feeling and hard words in view of supposed wrong: it stops just short of blows; any use beyond this is now figurative. Altercation is the spoken part of a quarrel, the parties speaking alternately. An altercation is thus a quarrelsome dispute between two persons or two sides. Affray and fray express a quarrel that has come to blows in a public place: they are often used of the struggles of war, implying personal activity. M\u00eal\u00e9e emphasizes the confusion in which those engaged in an affray or struggle are mingled. Brawl emphasizes the unbecoming character and noisiness of the quarrel; while broil adds the idea of entanglement, perhaps with several: two are enough for a brawl ; at least three are needed for a broil : as, a brawl with a neighbor; a neighborhood broil. A scuffle is, in this connection, a confused or undignified struggle, at close quarters, between two, to throw each other down, or a similar struggle of many. A wrangle is a severe, unreasoning, and noisy, perhaps confused, altercation. A squabble is a petty wrangle, but is even less dignified or irrational. A feud is a deeply rooted animosity between two sets of kindred, two parties, or possibly two persons.

Quickness, fastness, speed , and rapidity may have relation to time only, or to space passed through or over; the others apply only to space. \u201c Swift to hear,\u201d in Jas. i. 19, is a bold figure. Celerity is swift voluntary movement; but we do not ordinarily speak of the movements of an animal as having celerity. Fleetness also is voluntary, and is applied to animals; we may speak by figure of the fleetness of a yacht. The word suggests quickness in getting over the ground by the use of the feet: we speak of the swiftness or rapidity of the swallow's or the pigeon's flight; the fleetness of Atalanta, a hound, a deer. Swiftness is presumably not too great for carefulness or thoroughness; rapidity may be too great for either. Velocity is the attribute of matter in motion; the word is especially a technical term for the rate of movement of matter, whether fast or slow. We speak also of the velocity of sound or light. Rapidity has less suggestion of personality than any of the others, except velocity.
