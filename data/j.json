Referee is somewhat more loosely used. In legal usage referee means one to whom a pending cause or some branch of it is referred, with the sanction of the court, to act in place of the judge, or in aid of his determination, the result being a decision of the court; while an arbitrator is one to whom a question is referred simply by agreement of the parties, without sanction of the court. The reference of a pending cause to an arbitrator takes it out of court, and precludes further proceedings in court. In a boxing-match, boat-race, foot-ball game, etc., the referee is the same as an umpire. Sometimes an umpire is legally appointed to decide where arbitrators disagree.
