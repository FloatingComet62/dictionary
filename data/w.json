Wayward , by derivation, applies to one who turns away from what he is desired or expected to be or to do; but. from its seeming derivation, it has come to apply more often to one who turns toward ways that suit himself, whether or not they happen to be what others desire. Wilful suggests that the person is full of self-will, which asserts itself against those whose wishes ought to be deferred to or whose commands should be obeyed. Contrary and untoward express the same idea, the one in a positive, the other in a negative form. Contrary is an energetic word, expressing the idea that one takes, or is disposed to take, the course exactly opposite to that which he is expected or desired to take. Contrariness, when ingrained, becomes perverseness: as, a contrary disposition; a contrary fellow. This use of contrary is by many considered colloquial, but has the recommendation of figurative force. Contrary and untoward view the person as one to be managed; untoward views the person also as the object of mental or moral discipline: this perhaps through its use in Acts ii. 40. An untoward person is not responsive to persuasion, advice, influence, or requests; untoward circumstances are similarly such as do not help us in our plans. All these words imply that the only consistency in the person's conduct is in this self-willed independence of others' wishes or opposition to them, but untoward implies it least.

Some recent authorities teach that only that should be used when the relative clause is limiting or defining: as, the man that runs fastest wins the race; but who or which when it is descriptive or co\u00f6rdinating: as, this man, who ran fastest, won the race; but, though present usage is perhaps tending in the direction of such a distinction, it neither has been nor is a rule of English speech, nor is it likely to become one, especially on account of the impossibility of setting that after a preposition; for to turn all relative clauses into the form \u201cthe house that Jack lived in \u201d (instead of \u201cthe house in which Jack lived\u201d) would be intolerable. In good punctuation the defining relative is distinguished (as in the examples above), by never taking a comma before it, whether it be who or which or that. Wherever that could be properly used, but only there, the relative may be, and very often is, omitted altogether: thus, the house Jack built or lived in; the man (or the purpose) he built it for. The adjective clause introduced by a relative may qualify a noun in any way in which an adjective or adjective phrase, either attributive or appositional can qualify it, and has sometimes a pregnant implication of one or another kind: as, why punish this man, who is innocent? i. e. seeing, or although, he is innocent (= this innocent man). But a relative is also not rarely made use of to add a co\u00f6rdinate statement, being equivalent to and with a following pronoun: as, I studied geometry, which I found difficult ( and [ I ] found it difficult); I met a friend, who kindly showed me the way ( and he kindly, etc.).

Knowledge, Prudence, Wisdom., Discretion, Providence, Forecast, Provision. Knowledge has several steps, as the perception of facts, the accumulation of facts, and familiarity by experience, but it does not include action, nor the power of judging what is best in ends to be pursued or in means for attaining those ends. Prudence is sometimes the power of judging what are the best means for attaining desired ends; it may be a word or action, or it may be simply the power to avoid danger. It implies deliberation and care, whether in acting or refraining from action. Wisdom chooses not only the best means but also the best ends; it is thus far higher than prudence , which may by choosing wrong ends go altogether astray; hence also it is often used in the Bible for piety. As compared with knowledge , it sees more deeply into the heart of things and more broadly and comprehensively sums up relations, draws conclusions, and acts upon them; hence a man may abound in knowledge and be very deficient in wisdom , or he may have a practical wisdom with a comparatively small stock of knowledge. Discretion is the power to judge critically what is correct and proper, sometimes without suggesting action, but more often in view of action proposed or possible. Like prudence the word implies great caution, and takes for granted that a man will not act contrary to what he knows. Providence looks much further ahead than prudence or discretion , and plans and acts according to what it sees. It may be remarked that provision , which is from the same root as providence and prudence , is primarily a word of action, while they are only secondarily so. Forecast is a grave word for looking carefully forward to the consequences of present situations and decisions; it implies, like all these words except knowledge , that one will act according to what he can make out of the future.

One principal difference is that wit always lies in some form of words, while humor may be expressed by manner, as a smile, a grimace, an attitude. Underlying this is the fact, consistent with the original meaning of the words, that humor goes more deeply into the nature of the thought, while wit catches pleasing but occult or farfetched resemblances between things really unlike: a good pun shows wit ; Iiving's \u201cHistory of New York\u201d is a piece of sustained humor , the humor lying in the portrayal of character, the nature of the incidents, etc. Again, \u201c Wit may, I think, be regarded as a purely intellectual process, while humor is a sense of the ridiculous controlled by feeling, and coexistent often with the gentlest and deepest pathos\u201d ( H. Reed , Lects. on Eng. Lit., xi. 357). Hence humor is always kind, while wit may be unkind in the extreme: Swift's \u201cTravels of Gulliver\u201d is much too severe a satire to be called a work of humor. It is essential to the effect of wit that the form in which it is expressed should be brief; humor may be heightened in its effect by expansion into full forms of statement, description, etc Wit more often than humor depends upon passing circumstances for its effect."}, {"part_of_speech": "verb", "category": "", "explanation": "To know; to learn."}, {"part_of_speech": "noun", "category": "", "explanation": "Mind; intellect; understanding; sense."}, {"part_of_speech": "noun", "category": "", "explanation": "A mental faculty, or power of the mind; -- used in this sense chiefly in the plural, and in certain phrases."}, {"part_of_speech": "noun", "category": "", "explanation": "Felicitous association of objects not usually connected, so as to produce a pleasant surprise; also. the power of readily combining objects in such a manner."}, {"part_of_speech": "noun", "category": "", "explanation": "A person of eminent sense or knowledge; a man of genius, fancy, or humor; one distinguished for bright or amusing sayings, for repartee, and the like."}, {"part_of_speech": "noun", "category": "", "explanation": "the five senses; also, sometimes, the five qualities or faculties, common wit , imagination , fantasy , estimation , and memory ."}, {"part_of_speech": "preposition", "category": "", "explanation": "Alternative spelling of with ."}, {"part_of_speech": "verb", "category": "transitive, intransitive", "explanation": "Know , be aware of (construed with of when used intransitively)."}, {"part_of_speech": "noun", "category": "", "explanation": "Sanity ."}, {"part_of_speech": "noun", "category": "", "explanation": "The senses ."}, {"part_of_speech": "noun", "category": "", "explanation": "Intellectual ability; faculty of thinking, reasoning."}, {"part_of_speech": "noun", "category": "", "explanation": "The ability to think quickly; mental cleverness, especially under short time constraints."}, {"part_of_speech": "noun", "category": "", "explanation": "Intelligence; common sense."}, {"part_of_speech": "noun", "category": "", "explanation": "Spoken humour , especially when clever or quick."}, {"part_of_speech": "noun", "category": "", "explanation": "A person who tells funny anecdotes or jokes; someone witty."}, {"part_of_speech": "noun", "category": "", "explanation": "a message whose ingenuity or verbal skill or incongruity has the power to evoke laughter"}, {"part_of_speech": "noun", "category": "", "explanation": "a witty amusing person who makes jokes"}, {"part_of_speech": "noun", "category": "", "explanation": "mental ability"}], "witan": [{"part_of_speech": "noun plural", "category": "", "explanation": "The members of the witenagemot in Anglo-Saxon England."}, {"part_of_speech": "noun plural", "category": "", "explanation": "The witenagemot."}, {"part_of_speech": "noun", "category": "", "explanation": "In AngloSaxon hist , members of the witenagemot."}, {"part_of_speech": "noun plural", "category": "(A.-S.
