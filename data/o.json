This vowel-sound, the name-sound of o , is found in English usage only with long quantity in accented syllables. There is no closely corresponding short vowel in standard English, but only in dialectal pronunciation, as in the New England utterance of certain words (much varying in number in different individuals): for example, home, whole, none. What we call \u201cshort o \u201d (in not, on , etc.) is a sound of altogether different quality, very near to a true short \u00e4 (that is, a short utterance corresponding to the a of arm, father ), but verging slightly toward the \u201cbroad\u201d a ( \u00e2 ) or o ( \u00f4 ) of laud, lord. \u201cShort o \u201d has a marked tendency to take on a \u201cbroader\u201d sound, especially before r , and especially in America: hence the use, in the respellings of this work, of \u00f4 , which varies in different mouths from the full sound of \u00e2 to that of \u014f. After these three values of the character, the next most common one is that of the oo -sonnd, the original and proper sound of u (represented in this work by \u00f6 ), as in move , with the nearly corresponding short sound (marked u ) in a few words, as wolf, woman. All these vowel-sounds partake of what is usually called a \u201clabial\u201d or a \u201crounded\u201d character: that is to say, there is involved in their utterance a rounding and closing movement of the lips (and, it is held, of the whole mouth-cavity), in different degrees \u2014 least of all in \u014f , more and more in \u00e2, \u014d, u, \u00f6 ; in the last, carried to its extreme, no closer rounding and approximation being possible. The labial action helps to give the vowel-sounds in question their fully distinctive character; but it can be more or less slighted without leaving them unrecognizable, and, in the generally indifferent habit of English pronunciation, is in a degree neglected, even in accented syllables, and yet more in unaccented. Our \u201clong \u014d ,\u201d it should be added, regularly ends with a vanishing sound of oo ( \u00f6 ), as our \u0101 with one of \u0113. O also has in many words the value of the \u201cneutral\u201d vowels of hut, hurt : for example, in son, come, love, work. O is further a member of several very common and important digraphs: thus, oo , the most marked representative of the \u00f6 -sound (in moon, rood , etc.), but also pronounced as u ( book, look , etc.) and \u016d ( blood , etc.); ou (in certain situations ow ), oftenest representing a real diphthong (in out, sound, now , etc.), but also a variety of other sounds (as in through, could, ought, rough ); oi (in certain situations oy ), standing for a real diphthongal sound of which the first element is the \u201cbroad\u201d o - or a -sound (for example, point, boy ); oa ( load , etc.), having the \u201clong\u201d o -sound; others, as eo (variously pronounced, as in people, yeoman, jeopard ), oe (in foe, does , etc.), are comparatively rare."}, {"part_of_speech": " ", "category": "", "explanation": "medieval musical notation , the sign of the tempus perfectum \u2014 that is, of triple rhythm.

In regard to what a person does as a regular work or a means of earning a livelihood, occupation is that which occupies or takes up his time, strength, and thought; calling and vocation are high words, indicating that one is called by Providence to a particular line of work; calling is Anglo-Saxon and familiar, and vocation is Latin and lofty (the words are not always used in the higher sense of divine appointment or the call of duty, but it is much better to save them for the expression of that idea); employment is essentially the same as occupation; pursuit is the line of work which one pursues or follows; business suggests something of the management of buying and selling; trade and profession stand over against each other for the less and more intellectual pursuits, as the trade of a carpenter, the profession of an architect; trade is different from a trade , the latter being skill in some handicraft: as, being obliged to learn a trade , he chose that of a blacksmith; the \u201clearned professions \u201d used to be law, medicine, and the ministry, but the number is now increased; craft is an old word for a trade; office suggests the idea of duties to be performed for others.
