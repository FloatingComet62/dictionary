This sound, namely, implies for its formation the same check or mute-contact as d and t , with sonant vibration of the vocal cords as in d , and further with unclosure of the passage from the mouth into the nose, and nasal resonance there. Among the nasals, it is by far the most common in English pronunciation (more than twice as common as m , and eight times as common as ng ). While all the nasals are semivocalic or liquid, n is the only one which (like l , but not more than half as often) is used with vocalic value in syllable-making: namely, in unaccented syllables, where an accompanying vowel, formerly uttered, is now silenced: examples are token, rotten, open, lesson, reason, oven; such form, on an average, about one in eight hundred of English syllables. The sign n has no variety of sounds; but before ch, j , in the same syllable (as in inch, hinge ) it takes on a slightly modified\u2014a palatalized\u2014character; and similarly it is gutturalized, or pronounced as ng , before k and g (hard), as in ink, finger; and its digraph ng (see G ) is the usual representative of the guttural or back-palatal nasal, which in none of our alphabets has a letter to itself. N is doubled under the same circumstances as other consonants, and in a few words (as kiln, damn, hymn ) is silent. In the phonetic history of our family of languages, n is on the whole a constant sound; that is to say, there is no other sound into which it passes on a large scale; but its loss, with accompanying vowel-modification, has been a frequent process."}, {"part_of_speech": " ", "category": "", "explanation": "chem. , the symbol for nitrogen."}, {"part_of_speech": " ", "category": "", "explanation": "mathematics , an indefinite constant whole number, especially the degree of a quantic or an equation, or the class of a curve."}, {"part_of_speech": " ", "category": "", "explanation": "north or northern;"}, {"part_of_speech": " ", "category": "", "explanation": "noun (so used in this work);"}, {"part_of_speech": " ", "category": "", "explanation": "neuter;"}, {"part_of_speech": " ", "category": "", "explanation": "nail (or nails ), a measure."}, {"part_of_speech": "noun", "category": "", "explanation": "An abbreviation of New Brunswick ; of North Britain ; of North British."}, {"part_of_speech": "noun", "category": "", "explanation": "An abbreviation of New Church ; of North Carolina."}, {"part_of_speech": "noun", "category": "", "explanation": "An abbreviation of no date ."}, {"part_of_speech": " ", "category": "", "explanation": "National Guard ;"}, {"part_of_speech": " ", "category": "", "explanation": "no good or no go."}, {"part_of_speech": "noun", "category": "", "explanation": "An abbreviation of New England ;"}, {"part_of_speech": "noun", "category": "", "explanation": "of northeast ;"}, {"part_of_speech": "noun", "category": "", "explanation": "of Northeastern Postal District, London."}, {"part_of_speech": " ", "category": "", "explanation": "Newfoundland ;"}, {"part_of_speech": " ", "category": "", "explanation": "New French ;"}, {"part_of_speech": " ", "category": "", "explanation": "Norman French."}, {"part_of_speech": " ", "category": "", "explanation": "New Granada ;"}, {"part_of_speech": " ", "category": "", "explanation": "Noble Grand."}, {"part_of_speech": "noun", "category": "", "explanation": "An abbreviation of New Hampshire ."}, {"part_of_speech": "noun", "category": "", "explanation": "An abbreviation of Native Infantry ."}, {"part_of_speech": " ", "category": "", "explanation": "Nationalist ;"}, {"part_of_speech": " ", "category": "", "explanation": "meteor., of nimbus ;"}, {"part_of_speech": " ", "category": "", "explanation": "chem. , of normal , in reference to the strength of a solution; \u2044110 n. stands for one tenth normal strength, or a normal solution diluted tenfold: also written / 10 or / 10 .

Notations are employed to advantage in every branch of mathematics, in logic, in astronomy, in chemistry, in music, in proofreading, etc. Thus, (1 / i ) means that in the expression 1 / i all the whole numbers from 1 to n inclusive are to be successively substituted for i and the resulting values added together to give the quantity denoted by the expression. When the limits are not indicated, the lower one is to be understood as constant, and generally zero, and the upper one as one less than the actual value of the variable. For example, if we write \u03f2 (2 x + 1) = x , this signifies In like manner, \u03b4 is used to signify the difference, or the amount by which the quantity written after it would be increased by increasing the variable by unity. The variable may be indicated by a subjacent letter; thus, \u03b4 xx = ( x + 1) \u2014x ; but \u03b4 y x = x + 1 \u2014 x y = ( x \u2014 1) x y . The product of two quantities is denoted by writing them in their order, either directly, or with an interposed cross or dot (.); thus, 3 x a = 3. a = 3 a . A quotient is usually denoted by one of the signs \u00f7 or: or /, with the dividend before it and the divisor after it, or by a horizontal line with the dividend above and the divisor below. A continued product is also written with 11, just as a summation is written with \u03f2 ; but when the limits are not indicated, the lower one is constant, and generally unity, and the upper one the actual value of the variable. A positive whole number with the mark of admiration (!) after it denotes the continued product of all numbers from 1 up to that number inclusive; thus, 4! = 24. Instead of the mark of admiration, a right-angled line beneath and at the left of the number is sometimes used: as, A power of a quantity is denoted by writing the exponent to the right and above the base; thus. x = x. x. x. This notation is extended to symbols of operation. Thus, \u03b4 u = \u03b4\u03b4 u ; and \u03b4\u2014 u = \u03f2 u , because u = \u03b4\u03b4\u2014 u = \u03b4 u . If the exponent is included in parentheses, the quantity denoted is the continued product of a number of factors equal to the exponent, one factor being the base, and the others the results of successive subtractions of 1 from the base; thus, x () = x ( x\u2014 1) ( x \u20142). A root is denoted either by a fractional exponent, or by the sign \u221a written before the base, with the index above and to the left; thus, If the index is omitted, it is understood to be 2. One of the most important parts of algebraical notation is the use of parentheses, ( ), square brackets, [ ], braces, , and vincula or horizontal lines above the expressions, to signify that the symbols so included are to be treated as signifying one quantity. Thus, (3 + 2) x 5 = 25, but 3 + (2 x 5) = 13. Functions are usually denoted by operative symbols, especially f , F, \u03c6, \u03a6, written before the variable, the latter being often inclosed in parentheses. If there are several variables, these are inclosed in one parenthesis and separated by commas, as F ( x, y ). Various special functions have special abbreviations, as log for logarithm, sin for sine, cos for cosine, tan for tangent, cot for cotangent, sec for secant, cosec for cosecant, vsin for versed sine, sinh for hyperbolic sine, am for amplitude, sn for sine of the amplitude, cn for cosine of the amplitude, etc. (For the special notation of matrices, determinants, graphs, and groups, see those words.) A differential is expressed by d before the function, and a partial differential is now generally written with \u03b4 instead of d ; the variable is indicated, if necessary, by a subjacent letter. A variation is expressed by a \u03b4 before the varying quantity. A differential coefficient is most frequently expressed fractionally as a ratio of differentials, or by etc., written before the function. But the capital D is often used: thus, D x x y = yx\u2014 1, and D x x y = log x. x. Differentiation relatively to the time is frequently expressed by accents: thus, s\u2032 = D t s\u2032 and s\u2032 = D t s\u2032 . Dots over the letters are also used instead of the accents, this being the original fluxional notation of Newton. The differential coefficients of a function are frequently denoted by accents attached to the operational symbols: thus, f\u2033x = D x fx. A number of other differential operations are indicated by special operational symbols, as for Laplace's operator. The integral of an expression is written with the sign f , introduced by Leibnitz, before the differential. The limits of a definite integral are written above and below this sign.

In the meshes of the network is found the more fluid part of the nucleus, the nucleoplasm (achromatin, karyochylema, paralinin). Nucleoplasm, according to Carnoy, consists of a plastin network and a granular fluid, \u201cenchylema.\u201d The nuclear membrane is considered by some observers to be an inner limiting layer of cell-protoplasm surrounding the nucleus, by others to be a condensation of the peripheral portion of the nuclear network. There may be but one nucleus or several nuclei in one cell; and a nucleus may be nucleolate or not. Nuclei are generally proportionate in size to the cell containing them: in some instances, however, they form almost the entire cell mass. A structural difference between the nucleus and the rest of the cell-protoplasm is indicated by its greater resistance to powerful reagents, and by its varied reaction with stains. Functionally, the nucleus is the most important portion of the cell, as it is here that the complex series of changes known as karyokinesis take place, resulting in the division of the nucleus and followed by the division of the cell. This process of mitosic or indirect cell-division is found in all varieties of cells, whether vegetable or animal, fetal or adult, normal or pathological. Instances of cell-division not mitosic have, however, been noted. The nucleus of the human ovum was discovered by Purkinje in 1825, and hence is often called the corpuscle of Purkinje.
